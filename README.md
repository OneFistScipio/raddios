# Raddios
Raddios is a tool I wrote partially with ChatGPT because I needed help and StackOverflow sucks.
Raddios takes your local IP and scans all IP addresses within your IP range on shodan, then displays the results within the terminal.

# Usage
>git clone https://github.com/OneFistScipio/raddios/

>cd raddios

>pip install -r requirements.txt

>python exec.py
